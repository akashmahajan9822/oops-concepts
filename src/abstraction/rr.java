When we use abstract keyword in method context then that method will not have body.


When we use abstarct keyword for class it means at least one mthod of the class is of abstract category.



Sub class is responsible to provide the implamentation to the abstract method of abstarct class.

Abstract class can have complete as well as (concreate method) abstarct (incomplmeted) method.


We can not create object of abstract class. Beacuse if at least one method in the class is abstract then to provide implmention
to that method is responsiblility of sub class. so we achieving nothing by creating object of abstract class.

We can have the construtor of abstarct class.
